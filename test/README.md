## üÜï New Timestamp & Timezone Tests

### Issue Description
The application has been experiencing an issue where the data freshness indicator shows data as "10 hours old" even when data was recently refreshed. This appears to be related to timezone handling between UTC and Sydney time.

### Test Files

#### 1. `test-timestamp-timezone.ts`
**Comprehensive timestamp and timezone test**
- Runs bet_recoveries to refresh opportunities table
- Pulls opportunities table data
- Analyzes timestamps in Sydney time vs UTC
- Verifies data freshness calculations
- Identifies timezone conversion issues

Usage:
```bash
npx ts-node test/test-timestamp-timezone.ts
```

#### 2. `verify-database-timestamps.ts`
**Database timestamp verification test**
- Checks current database state
- Analyzes timestamp formats and calculations
- Tests API response for freshness
- Provides specific recommendations

Usage:
```bash
npx ts-node test/verify-database-timestamps.ts
# OR
node test/run-timestamp-verification.js
```

#### 3. `test-timestamp-issue.ts`
**Direct timestamp issue analysis**
- Simulates the sydneyTimestamp() function behavior
- Tests for timezone confusion
- Shows the likely cause of the "10 hours old" issue
- Provides clear recommendations

Usage:
```bash
npx ts-node test/test-timestamp-issue.ts
```

### Expected Issues to Find

1. **sydneyTimestamp() function**: Despite its name, it returns UTC time (`new Date().toISOString()`)
2. **Mixed timezone handling**: Some parts of the app may be mixing UTC and Sydney timezone calculations
3. **Data freshness calculation**: The 10-hour discrepancy likely comes from timezone offset confusion

### How to Run Tests

#### Individual Tests
```bash
# Comprehensive test
npx ts-node test/test-timestamp-timezone.ts

# Database verification
npx ts-node test/verify-database-timestamps.ts

# Issue analysis
npx ts-node test/test-timestamp-issue.ts
```

#### Using the Test Runners
```bash
# Database verification with runner
node test/run-timestamp-verification.js

# Timestamp test with runner
node test/run-timestamp-test.js
```

### Understanding the Results

#### Fresh Data (Expected)
- Age in seconds: < 60
- Is fresh: true
- Is stale: false

#### Stale Data (10+ hours old - Issue)
- Age in seconds: > 36000 (10+ hours)
- Is fresh: false
- Is stale: true
- Likely cause: Timezone offset confusion

#### What to Look For
- **Large age values**: If data shows as hours old when it should be minutes
- **Timezone offset discrepancies**: Differences between UTC and Sydney calculations
- **Double timezone conversion**: Converting Sydney time to Sydney time again

### Recommendations Based on Test Results

1. **If sydneyTimestamp() is the issue**:
   - Rename to `utcTimestamp()` for clarity
   - OR fix it to return actual Sydney time
   - Ensure consistent usage throughout the app

2. **If mixed timezone handling is found**:
   - Use UTC for all internal calculations
   - Only convert to Sydney time for display
   - Ensure API responses provide UTC timestamps

3. **If double conversion is happening**:
   - Check data-freshness-indicator.tsx component
   - Verify that ageInSeconds comes from server-side UTC calculation
   - Ensure formatSydneyTime() only formats, doesn't calculate age

## üöÄ Existing Bet Recoveries Tests

## ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented

We have successfully built and tested the bet recoveries functionality for Hit the Books! This system fetches live sports betting odds from external APIs, calculates arbitrage opportunities, and posts them to Supabase.

## üìÅ Files Created

### Core Implementation
- **`lib/betting/bet_recoveries.ts`** - Next.js server version (for production)
- **`lib/betting/bet_recoveries_standalone.ts`** - Standalone version (for testing/scripts)

### Test Scripts
- **`test/test-bet-recoveries.ts`** - Comprehensive test suite
- **`test/simple-test.ts`** - Simple functionality test
- **`test/debug-database.ts`** - Database debugging script
- **`test/run-test.js`** - Test runner
- **`test/run-bet-recoveries.js`** - Simple bet recoveries runner

## üéØ Functionality Overview

### What It Does
1. **Fetches Live Odds**: Connects to The Odds API to get real-time betting odds
2. **Calculates Arbitrage**: Finds profitable betting opportunities using advanced algorithms
3. **Handles Multiple Bet Types**:
   - **Bonus Bets**: Free bet arbitrage opportunities
   - **Turnover Bets**: Low-hold arbitrage opportunities
4. **Applies Betfair Commission**: Accounts for Betfair exchange commission rates
5. **Posts to Supabase**: Saves opportunities to the `opportunities` table

### Sports Covered
- AFL (Australian Football League)
- NRL (National Rugby League)
- A-League (Australian Soccer)
- NBL (National Basketball League)
- Big Bash Cricket

### Bookmakers Supported
- Sportsbet, TAB, Ladbrokes, Neds, PointsBet

2. **Supabase Connection** - Successfully connected to database
3. **Odds API Connection** - Connected to 63 available sports
4. **Bet Recoveries Processing** - **500 opportunities processed successfully!**
5. **Database Integration** - Data successfully inserted into Supabase

### üéØ Performance Metrics
- **Processing Time**: ~3 seconds
